# Penguin Slide

This is a <b>windows</b> desktop game, built for my school's logic competition event. 

## Installing
1. Download -> PenguinSlide IRGL2015 - Final.zip 
2. Extract the files
3. Run .exe file (there might be some missing .dll file. Search and download it in google.)

## Built With
* C++ with visual studio platform
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

## Objectives
The objective of the game is to help the missing penguin(top left, first index) to go back to its family (in the right side of the box). The penguin cannot (literally) move, hence once the path is correctly connected to its family, press the Go! button to check the path.
